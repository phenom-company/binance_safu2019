Spider is a Ð¡rypto scoring platform that allows checking if crypto wallet has ever been involved in transfers of illegally obtained funds and helps businesses to meet AML regulation requirements.

## Calculated metrics

**Score** - probability with which the funds from the current wallet balance are obtained illegally.
